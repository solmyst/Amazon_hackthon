## 1. Executive Summary

Our solution employs a multimodal ensemble approach combining text and image features to predict product prices. We extract comprehensive features from catalog content and product images, then use multiple machine learning models in an ensemble to achieve robust price predictions.

## 2. Methodology Overview

### 2.1 Problem Analysis

The pricing challenge requires understanding the relationship between product attributes (text descriptions, images) and their market prices. Key insights from our analysis:

**Key Observations:**
- Product descriptions contain valuable pricing signals (quantities, units, quality indicators)
- Text length and complexity correlate with product sophistication and price
- Numerical values in descriptions (weights, counts) are strong price predictors
- Product categories (food, beauty, etc.) have distinct pricing patterns
- Brand and quality indicators significantly impact pricing

### 2.2 Solution Strategy

**Approach Type:** Multimodal Ensemble  
**Core Innovation:** Combined text feature engineering with deep image features using pre-trained ResNet50, integrated through weighted ensemble of multiple regression models.
